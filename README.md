      <h2>What is a heat pump?</h2>
      <p>A heat pump is a device that extracts heat from the air or ground outside your home and uses it to heat your home. This can be a cost-effective way to heat your home, especially if you live in a warm climate.</p>
      <h2>Why should I install a heat pump?</h2>
      <p>Heat pumps can save you money on your energy bills compared to traditional heating systems. They are also better for the environment because they do not produce greenhouse gases like fossil fuel-based heating systems do.</p>
      <h2>What government aid is available?</h2>
      <p>The government offers several programs to help homeowners install heat pumps. Some programs offer rebates or tax credits, while others provide low-interest loans or other financial assistance. It is important to research the programs available in your area to determine what assistance you may be eligible for.</p>
